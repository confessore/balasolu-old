### Other Third-Party Cookies

Individual pages on our site may set other third-party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that we do not operate or control and such content may set a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control what cookies this third-party content sets or the privacy practices of such sites.

### Interest-Based Advertising

We work with third-parties such as ad networks and other advertising companies that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our site and app other websites and apps in order to provide you with tailored advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity across your different devices on our site and app and third-party websites and apps (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you both on and off our site and apps. This information may also be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns.

We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada’s (DAAC) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising. For more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioural ads from participating third-party advertising companies, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website as at http://youradchoices.ca/choices.

To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third-party advertising companies that participate in the DAAC’s AppChoices tool, please download the version of AppChoices for your device at https://youradchoices.ca/appchoices/.

To successfully opt-out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser. Please see your browser’s instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them. Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each device that you use. Once you opt out, if you delete your browser’s saved cookies, you may need to opt-out again.

Please note that even if you opt-out interest-based advertising by a third party as set out above, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.
